# --- STEP 2: Adding bias --- #
# Look at your variables and use an if-statement to create a label
# A very simple one could be age. If a user is 18+ the variable "safe_content" would be set to True.


# Using the age for now to identify boomers

# --- STEP 1: Getting the data --- #
# ‚úÖ Create a welcome message welcoming the user using the included your_social_media_app_name variable
# ‚úÖ Ask the user for a username, password, year of birth, and any other relevant information for your social media app
# While doing so think of the bias your variables might enable
# Calculate the age using the year of birth and create an extra variable age
# Use input() for this and store each data type in a seperate variable


# --- STEP 6: Security measures --- #
# Let the user login using a if-statement
# The login only has to work once
# Display if the user successfully logged in or not

# --- STEP 4: Adding a friend --- #
# Nothing worse than a lecturer wanting to become your friend. 
# Ask the user if the your_new_friend can become their friend
# Use an if-statement to either display "Friend request accepted" or "Friend request declined"


def checkFriendRequest():
    your_new_friend = "Erik"

# --- STEP 5: Adding content --- #
# Ask the user to write a short content message (use a variable)
# Display the message and ask if the user wants to publish the message
# Use an if-statement to either display "Message posted" or "Message deleted"
